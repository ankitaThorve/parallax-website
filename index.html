        <h2>Section One</h2>
        <p>Nature is a simple definition of the physical world and everything in it that is not made by people, including plants, animals, mountains, oceans, and stars. It also includes all the features, forces, and processes that exist or happen independently of people, such as the weather, the sea, mountains, reproduction, and growth. Nature can refer to the general realm of living plants and animals, and in some cases to the processes associated with inanimate objects—the way that particular types of things exist and change of their own accord, such as the weather and geology of the Earth.
